# mach-zed

[Zed](https://zed.dev) extension for the [Mach](https://github.com/briar-systems/mach) programming language.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** via [mach-tree-sitter](https://github.com/briar-systems/mach-tree-sitter)
- **Auto-indentation** for blocks, records, unions, parameter lists, and initializer lists
- **Bracket matching** and auto-closing for `{}`, `[]`, `()`, `""`, `''`
- **Comment toggling** with `#`
- **LSP integration** with [mach-lsp](https://github.com/briar-systems/mach-lsp) (when available on `$PATH`)

## Installation

### From the Zed Extension Registry

Once published, search for **Mach** in Zed's extension panel (`zed: extensions`) and click **Install**.

### Manual / Development

Clone this repository and symlink or copy it into your Zed extensions directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briar-systems/mach-zed.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/mach-zed" ~/.local/share/zed/extensions/installed/mach
```

Restart Zed to pick up the extension.

## Language Server

This extension ships a Rust WASM extension that tells Zed how to locate and start `mls`. When you open a `.mach` file, Zed will:

1. Check your Zed settings for a user-configured binary path (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).
2. Look for `mls` on your system `$PATH`.
3. If neither is found, display an error with instructions.

### Building mach-lsp

Build `mach-lsp` from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briar-systems/mach-lsp.git
cd mach-lsp
mach dep pull
mach build .
```

The binary will be at `out/{target}/{profile}/bin/mls` (e.g. `out/linux/debug/bin/mls` for a default debug build on Linux). Add it to your `$PATH`:

```bash
cp out/linux/debug/bin/mls ~/.local/bin/
```

### Building the WASM Extension

If you're developing the extension locally and need to rebuild the WASM component:

```bash
cd mach-zed
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
```

> **Note:** You need the `wasm32-wasip1` target installed:
> ```bash
> rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
> ```

The compiled `.wasm` file will be at `target/wasm32-wasip1/release/mach_zed.wasm`. Zed handles building and loading the WASM automatically when installing from the extension registry or from a local dev extension directory.

## Configuration

### Editor Settings

You can customize Mach-specific editor settings in your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "languages": {
        "Mach": {
            "tab_size": 4,
            "hard_tabs": false,
            "format_on_save": "off"
        }
    }
}
```

### Language Server Binary

If `mls` is not on your `$PATH`, or you want to use a specific build, configure the binary path in your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "lsp": {
        "mls": {
            "binary": {
                "path": "/absolute/path/to/mls",
                "arguments": []
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## How It Works

Zed extensions with language server support require a Rust WASM component that implements the `Extension` trait from `zed_extension_api`. The key method is `language_server_command`, which returns the command Zed should execute to start the LSP.

The extension resolves the `mls` binary in this order:

1. **User settings** — `lsp.mls.binary.path` in Zed's `settings.json`
2. **Cached path** — a previously resolved path that still exists on disk
3. **System PATH** — `worktree.which("mls")` searches `$PATH`

If none of these succeed, Zed shows an error message guiding the user to install `mls`.

## Contributing

1. Clone this repo alongside [mach-tree-sitter](https://github.com/briar-systems/mach-tree-sitter).
2. Edit queries in `languages/mach/` and reload the Zed extension to test.
3. For grammar changes, update `mach-tree-sitter` and bump the `rev` in `[grammars.mach]` of `extension.toml`.
4. For LSP integration changes, edit `src/lib.rs` and rebuild the WASM component.

> **Highlight queries are coupled to the grammar.** A query may only reference
> node types and tokens that the pinned `mach-tree-sitter` revision actually
> produces — referencing a node or token the grammar does not emit makes Zed
> drop the entire query file. So query updates for new syntax must land
> *together with* a grammar bump, never ahead of one. Validate every query file
> against the pinned grammar before committing (`tree-sitter query <file>.scm
> sample.mach` must exit cleanly for each).
>
> The grammar now matches the authoritative `doc/language/grammar.md`, and the
> queries cover the full surface, including:
>
> - `:~` bit-reinterpret and `::` value casts — `(cast_expression operator: _
>   @operator)`.
> - `fwd` re-export declarations — `"fwd" @keyword`, plus a
>   `forward_declaration` outline item and alias highlight.
> - `$`-prefixed comptime value parameters / fields (`fun f($x: T)`, `$tag: T;`)
>   — `(parameter comptime: "$" ...)` and `(field_declaration comptime: "$"
>   ...)`.
> - The `asm <isa> { ... }` ISA-tag form — `(asm_statement isa: (identifier))`
>   and `(asm_statement body: (asm_body))`; the raw body is one `asm_body` node.
> - `#[attr]` decorators (`#[symbol("...")]`, `#[inline]`, `#[align(expr)]`,
>   `#[section(...)]`, `#[library(...)]`) — `(decorator "#[" name: (identifier)
>   @attribute)`; argument expressions keep their own highlights.
> - Comptime variadic packs — `(pack_parameter name: (identifier))` for `va: ...`,
>   the `$each a in va { ... }` unroll (`comptime_each_statement`, `$`/`each`/`in`
>   keywords), and the `va...` `pack_spread_expression` ellipsis.
> - Secret values: `^T` is a `secret_type` with its marker highlighted as a type
>   qualifier, while `value:^T` is a `secret_strip_expression` with its operator
>   highlighted as an operator.
> - `#[attr]` annotations: both `#[` and `]` are `punctuation.special`. The
>   decorator query follows the broad bracket captures so they do not overwrite
>   the closing delimiter's annotation highlight.
>
> Note `pub` / `ext` are repeatable `modifiers` children of each declaration
> (there is no `public_declaration` or `extern_declaration` node), and there is
> no method-receiver syntax. `&` is the bitwise-AND operator, so it highlights as
> an operator rather than a pointer sigil.
